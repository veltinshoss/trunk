<p>Interfaces that represent the structure of filetypes so that they can be exposed as typesafe objects. Some structure can be inferred from the structure and names of the interfaces methods, and this can be supplemented through the use of annotations.
<p>These interfaces interfaces are passed either by the system or directly by the user to dynamic proxies which then expose the given file through the interface, performing all the mapping internally and hidden from the user.
