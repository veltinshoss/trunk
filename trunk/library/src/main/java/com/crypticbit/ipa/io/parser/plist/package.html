<p>This package is responsible for parsing a plist file and exposing it as a parsed file, as described in monkeypuzzle.io.parser.
<p>It supports both binary and xml formats, and can reenerate xml from both, effectively allowing the conversion of binary plists to xml plists
@see moneypuzzle.io.parser
