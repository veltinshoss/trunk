<body>
<p>Exposes plist files (both binary and xml) through a typesafe
interface.
<p>For example this means that if you had a plist with the following
structure:
<pre>
ROOT
 Array of "Bookmark" 
 
Bookmark
 Dictionary of BookmarkItem
 
BookmarkItem
 String: name
 String: url
 
</pre>

then passing the following simple interface:
<pre>
public interface Bookmarks
{
	public interface BookmarkItem
	{
		@PListAnnotationEntry("name")
		public String getName();

		@PListAnnotationEntry("url")
		public String getUrl();
	}

	@PListAnnotationEntry("Bookmark")
	public BookmarkItem[] getItems();
</pre>

to the
<code>PListResults</code>
will allow data items to be looked up in the typesafe way:
<pre>
Bookmarks bookmarks = ... // see the PListResults class for how to do this
System.out.println(bookmarks[0].getUrl());
</pre>
In this situation many of the annotations are actually surpurfluous, as
the default is to use the lowercase version of the getter name if no
annotation is provided. For example
<code>getName</code>
would infer the annotation
<code>@PListAnnotationEntry("name")</code>
. The only annotation for plists is
<code>PListAnnotationEntry</code>
which links the underlying data field with the interface method. The
return type of the method also relevant:
<ul>
	<li>If the return type is another interface it will recursively
	apply the dynamic proxy to that field.
	<li>If it is a subclass of <code>PListContainer</code> then that
	node will be coerced to that value if possible. This allows access back
	to the underlying data structure that represents a tree or subtree of a
	plist.
	<li>For primitive values (at the leaf of the tree) it will try to
	coerce the value to the return type.
</ul>
<p>If the annotation indicates a zero length name of field it will use the current object as the identity, which allows the current objetc to be converted, exposed as another interface or more usually allow access to the underlying datastructure in the form of a <code>PListContainer</code>
<p>If a named field can not be found then if <code>DynamicProxyException</code>
is on the method exception list, otherwise null, 0 or false will be
returned depending on method type. @see PListAnnotationEntry
<p>In addition to the annotations the following methods have been
implemented:
<ul>
	<li>toString()
</ul>
